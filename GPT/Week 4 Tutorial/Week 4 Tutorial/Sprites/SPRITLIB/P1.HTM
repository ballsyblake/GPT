<h3>Introduction</h3>
<BR>
<P>
<i>SpriteLib</i> is a free sprite graphics library for all multimedia developers.  Containing well over 700 
professionally drawn images in over a dozen sizes and themes, <i>SpriteLib</i> is the ideal tool for developing the latest generation of games, educational programs and multimedia applications.
<BR>
<P>

<i>SpriteLib</i> was developed as a direct result of my experience as a commercial and shareware game artist.  It was designed to offer programmers of all levels a complete "plug-n-play" graphics solution to use freely in their creations.  This way, programmers can concentrate on creating applications with consistent, high quality artwork without worrying about the gory details of drawing the art themselves or hiring an expensive outside artist.  
<BR>
<P>
<i>SpriteLib</i> features all original computer artwork. Some of you might remember me (or maybe not!) from my earlier sprite product announced on rec.games.programmer called the Image Odyssey. Well, for a variety of reasons, the Image Odyssey was never officially released, however, the concept lives on in my SpriteLib product.

<i>SpriteLib</i> for Windows contains 25 screens packed with ready-to-use sprite artwork.  The following types of games and applications are supported right "out of the box" with SpriteLib:

<BR>
<P>
The Windows version of <i>SpriteLib</i> includes 640x400 images saved in the standard Windows Bitmap (.BMP) file format.  <B>NOTE:</B> 
I decided to use the RLE sub-format in order to save disk space in this distribution.  Most Windows based graphics packages such as PaintShop Pro and Photoshop are
fully compatible with RLE flavored BMP files, however, some programs are not (like the Windows 3.1 version of Paintbrush).<BR><P>
Most of the sprite screens use less than 64 unique colors, so SpriteLib is ideal for specialized applications like Shockwave. I've also tried to give developers as much leeway as possible by leaving plenty of color palette entries open and keeping most of the sprites small so they animate faster, even when used under high-level development environments like Director, etc.
<BR>
<P>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<BR>
<P>
On extracted from the distribution .ZIP file, all <I>SpriteLib</I> images can be found in the
SPRITES sub-directory.  You can keep the images here or move them to another location on your hard drive.  The images only need to remain in the SPRITES directory if intend to view them via this
program, etc.
<BR>
<P>

In return, registered users will be allowed to use the <i>SpriteLib</i> product without penalty and will be informed of future <i>SpriteLib</i> volumes as well as other products that I will be releasing.  In addition, I will be available online to answer specific questions about how I implemented the <i>SpriteLib</i> art and to provide tips on getting the most out of the package.
<BR>
<P>
<LI>
You must give me proper credit in your application's title/credits screen and documentation if you use at least five of the images contained in the <i>SpriteLib</i> package.  In addition, as a courtesy, I would appreciate (although you are not required) it if you sent me one free copy of every application or game you create with art featured in <i>SpriteLib</i>.  I simply want to see what's being done with my art!
<BR>
<P>
<LI>You can only use the Windows version of <i>SpriteLib</i> for creating Windows or Web based applications! You are not allowed to port the Windows version to any other hardware platform (I will be doing this myself in order to maintain quality control) and you MAY NOT use the images featured in <i>SpriteLib</i> to create ANY DOS based programs!  
</LI>
<BR>
<P>

<LI>You may not sell for profit any of the art contained in the <i>SpriteLib</i> package.  In other words, you are free to sell your program creations that use <i>SpriteLib</i> images (provided you are a registered user) but you may not sell the package or a modified version of it as a separate product.
</LI>
<BR>
<P><LI>You may not publicly distribute any of your programs or applications that use art found in <i>SpriteLib</i> if you are an unregistered user.</LI>
<BR>
<P>

I ask you to please respect these restrictions.  There really no incentive to violate them since I'm not charging for the use of this package.
<BR>

<H3>SpriteLib Updates</H3>


Yes, one of the perks of taking the time to register is that you will be able to receive updates to <i>SpriteLib</i> for free!  I will be making my Web site the official home for all product support and future <i>SpriteLib</i> releases. I still have a substantial amount of artwork that I haven't yet released and I plan to make it available to the Internet community at large provided that there is sufficient interest and that my registration requirements are respected.
<BR>
<P>
After August 1, registered users can visit my SpriteLib Internet page at: <i>http://www.walrus.com/~ari/spritlib.htm</I>
to download updates.
<BR>
<P>
In fact, one of the first upgrades that will be made available will be a background tile set which should prove very useful when used with the many arcade "platform" type sprites included in this package.
Eventually, I will release other background tile sets to support the other sprite sets found in <i>SpriteLib</i>.
<BR>
<P>
I hope you enjoy <i>SpriteLib</i> and I look forward to hearing from you!

<h3>Last Words</h3>
<BR>
<P>
Please note that most of the sprites contained in <i>SpriteLib</i> can be used to develop
entire games and programs.  Some of the sprites do not form complete themes by themselves.  However, I've given you
enough ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  If you're a budding artist or animator, you'll
find many of the included images perfect for practicing your skills.  This package contains
all sorts of effects from explosions to characters walking and jumping.  Just about every
sprite action is represented.  All you need now is a good imagination to make some real kick-ass
applications!  Good luck!
